USER INPUTS
- Goal description: ${input.goalDescription}
- Experience level: ${expLabel(input.experienceLevel)}
- Background: ${bgLabel(input.background)}
- Primary goal: ${goalLabel(input.goal)}
- Available time: ${String(input.hoursPerWeek)} hours per week
- Preferred study days: ${input.preferredDays.join(", ")}
- Already comfortable with: ${knownSkills}
- Must include topics: ${mustInclude}
- Avoid: ${avoid}

CONSTRAINTS
- Total estimatedHours must reflect a realistic plan that someone can finish in 8 to 20 weeks at the user's pace.
- Skip any topic the user is already comfortable with. Build on those skills instead of repeating them.
- Honor 'must include' topics by ensuring at least one section or topic explicitly covers them.
- Avoid 'avoid' topics entirely.
- Include 4 to 8 sections; each section has 3 to 6 topics.
- Each topic has a real summary, contentMd (2 to 4 short paragraphs of teaching, plain text or simple bullets, no markdown headings), realistic estimatedHours, difficulty 1-5, a single concrete miniProject, and a self-check question.
- Each topic has 2 to 5 RESOURCES with REAL, well-known URLs. Prefer official docs (mdn, react.dev, postgresql.org), university sites (MIT, freeCodeCamp), or canonical tutorials (javascript.info). Do not invent URLs. If you are unsure of a URL, omit that resource.
- Resources must be free.
- Use natural English. Do not include placeholders, lorem ipsum, or "TBD".
- Use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses for punctuation. Do NOT use the em dash character.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation, matching this exact shape. Strings are plain text. Numbers are integers unless noted.
