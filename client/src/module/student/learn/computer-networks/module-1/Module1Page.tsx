    question: "Which network type typically covers a single building or campus?",
    options: ["WAN", "MAN", "LAN", "PAN"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "A LAN (Local Area Network) covers a single building or campus. WANs span countries, MANs cover cities, and PANs cover personal-scale distances (~10 m).",
  },
  {
    question: "In a Star topology, what is the single point of failure?",
    options: ["Any leaf node", "The connecting cable", "The central hub or switch", "The network protocol"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "In a star topology, the central hub/switch connects all devices. If it fails, all devices lose connectivity - making it the single point of failure (SPOF).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary advantage of a Mesh topology over a Bus topology?",
    options: ["Lower cost", "Simpler to set up", "Higher fault tolerance", "Less cable required"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Mesh topology provides multiple paths between nodes. If any link fails, traffic can route around it - making it far more fault-tolerant than a bus.",
  },
  {
    question: "Bluetooth earphones connecting to a smartphone is an example of which network type?",
    options: ["LAN", "MAN", "WAN", "PAN"],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "Bluetooth operates at personal scale (~10 m). A PAN (Personal Area Network) covers devices in immediate proximity of a person.",
  },
  {
    question: "In a Client-Server model, which statement is correct?",
    options: [
      "Every node acts as both client and server",
      "Clients respond to requests from servers",
      "Clients send requests; servers respond",
      "Servers only exist on the internet",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "In Client-Server: clients initiate requests, servers respond. This is centralised. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is the model where every node is both client and server.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a protocol define?",
    options: [
      "The physical wiring of a network",
      "Rules for format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of data exchange",
      "The speed of a network connection",
      "The number of devices allowed on a network",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A protocol is a set of agreed rules covering format, timing, sequencing, and error-checking - enabling different devices and OSes to communicate reliably.",
  },
  {
    question: "A Ring topology with 5 nodes has how many links?",
    options: ["4", "5", "10", "3"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A ring connects each node to exactly two neighbours, forming a closed loop. With 5 nodes: 5 links total (each node provides one link forward).",
  },
  {
    question: "Which topology requires the most cable for N nodes?",
    options: ["Bus", "Star", "Ring", "Mesh"],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "A full mesh requires N(N-1)/2 links - every node connected to every other. For 5 nodes that's 10 links, far more than bus (4), ring (5), or star (4).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a 'packet' in networking?",
    options: [
      "A physical box used to ship hardware",
      "A unit of data transmitted across a network",
      "A type of network cable",
      "A hardware device that routes traffic",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A packet is a unit of data formatted for network transmission. Large messages are split into packets, each containing source/destination addresses and a portion of the payload.",
  },

    question: "Which of these is a WAN?",
    options: [
      "Office Wi-Fi connecting 30 laptops",
      "Bluetooth connection to wireless speaker",
      "The internet",
      "A city's cable TV provider backbone",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "The internet is the largest WAN - a global network of networks. Office Wi-Fi is a LAN, Bluetooth is a PAN, and a city backbone is a MAN.",
