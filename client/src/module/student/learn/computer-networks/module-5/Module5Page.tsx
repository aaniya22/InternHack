    question: "What is the correct sequence of the TCP 3-way handshake?",
    options: [
      "SYN → ACK → SYN-ACK",
      "SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK",
      "ACK → SYN → SYN-ACK",
      "SYN-ACK → SYN → ACK",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "The 3-way handshake is SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK. The client initiates with SYN, the server acknowledges and sends its own SYN in SYN-ACK, and the client confirms with ACK. This exchange ensures both sides can send and receive before data flows.",
  },
  {
    question: "A TCP ACK=1501 means the receiver is telling the sender:",
    options: [
      "1501 packets have been received",
      "Send segment number 1501 next",
      "I have received all bytes up to 1500  send byte 1501 next",
      "The window size is 1501 bytes",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "TCP ACK numbers are cumulative byte counters. ACK=1501 means 'I have successfully received everything up to and including byte 1500, please send byte 1501 next.' TCP numbers individual bytes, not segments.",
  },
  {
    question: "What triggers TCP Fast Retransmit without waiting for a timeout?",
    options: [
      "A FIN segment from the receiver",
      "Three duplicate ACKs for the same byte",
      "The sliding window reaching zero",
      "An ICMP Destination Unreachable message",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "When the sender receives 3 duplicate ACKs (all acknowledging the same byte), it infers a segment was lost and immediately retransmits  no need to wait for the RTO timer. This is TCP Fast Retransmit, and it significantly reduces recovery time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which phase of TCP congestion control grows the window exponentially?",
    options: [
      "Congestion Avoidance",
      "Fast Recovery",
      "Slow Start",
      "Fast Retransmit",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Slow Start doubles cwnd each RTT (exponential growth) until it reaches ssthresh. Despite its name, Slow Start is only 'slow' compared to an unbounded burst  it begins at cwnd=1 MSS. Congestion Avoidance grows linearly (+1 MSS per RTT).",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to TCP's congestion window (cwnd) when a timeout occurs?",
    options: [
      "cwnd is halved and slow start resumes from there",
      "cwnd resets to 1 MSS and ssthresh is halved",
      "cwnd stays the same and fast recovery begins",
      "cwnd doubles to compensate for the lost segment",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "On timeout (the most severe congestion signal), TCP sets cwnd=1 and ssthresh=cwnd/2, then re-enters Slow Start. This is more aggressive than the 3-dup-ACK response because a timeout suggests serious congestion  the network needs to drain.",
  },
  {
    question: "TCP flow control uses a receiver-advertised window. What happens when that window reaches zero?",
    options: [
      "The connection is reset (RST)",
      "The sender sends a FIN to close the connection",
      "The sender pauses and periodically sends Zero Window Probes to check for window updates",
      "The sender switches to UDP for the remaining data",
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "When the receiver's buffer is full it sets window=0 in the ACK. The sender stops transmitting but sends periodic Zero Window Probes to keep the connection alive. Once the receiver drains its buffer it sends a window update and data transfer resumes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which transport-layer protocol is best for a live video streaming application that prioritises low latency?",
    options: [
      "TCP  because it guarantees delivery",
      "UDP  because lost frames are acceptable and retransmits would add unacceptable latency",
      "TCP with a very large window size",
      "ICMP  it has no connection overhead",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Live video can tolerate occasional dropped frames far better than delayed ones. UDP fires packets immediately with no handshake, retransmit, or ordering overhead. TCP's reliability mechanisms would introduce jitter and stalls on loss events  unacceptable for real-time media.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the range of well-known (reserved) port numbers?",
    options: ["0–1023", "1024–49151", "49152–65535", "0–65535"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "Ports 0–1023 are IANA-assigned well-known ports: HTTP=80, HTTPS=443, SSH=22, DNS=53, SMTP=25. Ports 1024–49151 are registered (e.g. MySQL=3306). Ports 49152–65535 are dynamic/ephemeral  assigned by the OS for outgoing client connections.",
  },
  {
    question: "A TCP socket is uniquely identified by a 4-tuple. Which 4-tuple is correct?",
    options: [
      "Source MAC, Destination MAC, Source Port, Destination Port",
      "Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port",
      "Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, Sequence Number",
      "Source Port, Destination Port, TTL, Window Size",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "A TCP connection is identified by the 4-tuple: (Source IP, Source Port, Destination IP, Destination Port). This allows a server to maintain thousands of simultaneous connections on the same port because each client has a different source IP and ephemeral port.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the TIME_WAIT state ensure during TCP 4-way teardown?",
    options: [
      "The server has enough time to flush its send buffer",
      "The final ACK reaches the server before the port is reused",
      "Both sides confirm the connection is closed simultaneously",
      "The client can still receive retransmitted data segments",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "TIME_WAIT lasts 2×MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime, typically 2 minutes). It ensures the final ACK the client sent actually reaches the server. If it was lost, the server would retransmit its FIN and the client  still in TIME_WAIT  can re-send the ACK instead of sending a confusing RST.",
  },
  {
    question: "QUIC (used by HTTP/3) is built on top of UDP. Why use UDP instead of TCP?",
    options: [
      "UDP is encrypted by default, TCP is not",
      "UDP avoids TCP's head-of-line blocking and allows reliability to be implemented in userspace with better control",
      "UDP supports larger packet sizes than TCP",
      "UDP has a built-in 3-way handshake that QUIC reuses",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "TCP multiplexes streams but a single lost segment blocks all streams (head-of-line blocking). QUIC implements per-stream reliability over UDP in userspace, so a lost packet only stalls its own stream. QUIC also combines the TLS and transport handshakes into 0–1 RTT, vs TCP+TLS's 2–3 RTT.",
  },
  {
    question: "TCP Reno reduces cwnd to ssthresh+3 on 3-dup-ACKs and enters Fast Recovery. How does this differ from TCP Tahoe's response?",
    options: [
      "Tahoe also enters Fast Recovery, but from a higher starting cwnd",
      "Tahoe resets cwnd to 1 and re-enters Slow Start, which is more aggressive",
      "Reno resets to 1; Tahoe keeps cwnd at ssthresh",
      "There is no difference  both use the same algorithm",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "TCP Tahoe treats 3-dup-ACKs the same as a timeout: cwnd=1, re-enter Slow Start. TCP Reno distinguishes them  3-dup-ACKs are a 'mild' signal so it halves cwnd to ssthresh and enters Fast Recovery (staying in CA phase). Reno recovers faster because it doesn't drop back to 1.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the purpose of TCP sequence numbers?",
    options: [
      "To identify each TCP connection uniquely across the network",
      "To number each byte so the receiver can detect gaps, reorder segments, and ACK correctly",
      "To set the priority of each segment in the queue",
      "To map port numbers to socket descriptors in the OS",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Sequence numbers let TCP track exactly which bytes have been received. If segment 1001–2000 arrives before 501–1000, the receiver can reorder them. If a gap exists (501–1000 missing), the receiver keeps ACKing 500  triggering fast retransmit for the lost segment.",
  },
  {
    question: "UDP header size is _____ bytes. TCP header (minimum) is _____ bytes.",
    options: ["8 … 20", "20 … 8", "4 … 16", "12 … 24"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "UDP has a fixed 8-byte header: Source Port (2B), Dest Port (2B), Length (2B), Checksum (2B). TCP's minimum header is 20 bytes, with optional fields extending it to 60 bytes. This overhead difference is why UDP is faster for small, latency-sensitive messages.",
  },
  {
    question: "DNS uses UDP for standard queries. What makes UDP appropriate here?",
    options: [
      "DNS queries require ordered delivery to resolve correctly",
      "DNS requests are short, fit in a single datagram, and the application can retry on timeout",
      "UDP provides encryption for DNS records",
      "UDP is required by the IANA standard for all lookup protocols",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "DNS queries are tiny request-response pairs that fit in a single UDP datagram. If no reply arrives, the client simply retries. There's no need for TCP's connection setup and retransmission machinery for such short exchanges  it would add needless latency.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'additive increase, multiplicative decrease' (AIMD) describe in TCP?",
    options: [
      "Slow Start: cwnd doubles each RTT, drops to 1 on loss",
      "Congestion Avoidance: cwnd increases +1/RTT, halves on loss signal",
      "Fast Recovery: cwnd jumps to ssthresh, resets on timeout",
      "Window scaling: receiver window grows additively, resets on overflow",
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "AIMD describes TCP Congestion Avoidance: increase cwnd by 1 MSS per RTT (additive increase) when no congestion is detected; halve cwnd when a loss signal arrives (multiplicative decrease). This gentle sawtooth pattern allows many TCP flows to share a bottleneck link fairly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which TCP flag is used to initiate a connection?",
    options: ["ACK", "FIN", "RST", "SYN"],
    correctIndex: 3,
    explanation: "SYN (synchronise) is set in the first segment of a TCP connection. It tells the receiver 'I want to establish a connection and here is my initial sequence number.' ACK acknowledges data, FIN gracefully closes, and RST abruptly resets/terminates a connection.",
  },
  {
    question: "In TCP congestion control, what is ssthresh and how is it used?",
    options: [
      "Slow-start threshold  cwnd below it grows exponentially; above it grows linearly",
      "The maximum advertised receiver window",
      "The retransmission timeout value in milliseconds",
      "The number of duplicate ACKs before fast retransmit fires",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation: "ssthresh (slow-start threshold) divides Slow Start from Congestion Avoidance. When cwnd < ssthresh, TCP doubles cwnd each RTT (Slow Start). When cwnd >= ssthresh, TCP adds 1 MSS per RTT (Congestion Avoidance). After loss, ssthresh is halved so CA kicks in sooner on recovery.",
